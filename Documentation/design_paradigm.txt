We believe our Project 1 team to have used a top-down design paradigm for their project. The reason we believe this is because
in order to create a project like this with the UI and user experience in mind, some sort of top-down design must have been used.
Their top-down design might have looked at what the user would see, then broken down into classes, and with those classes it was broken
down into methods needed to implement those classes. So, in order to effectively organize what would be used to create the Battleship game,
a top-down design paradigm was used.
