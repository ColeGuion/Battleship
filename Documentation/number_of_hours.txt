File to store the team's thoughts on the number of hours requires to finish the project

Jiayi Fu estimate - 30hrs
Samuel Jerguson estimmate - 35hrs
Alec Mcglynn estimate - 30hrs
Benjamin Moeller estimate - 40hrs
Blake Richmeier estimate - 30hrs

Average Hours Estimate - 33hrs

How we got to that conclusion:
We each got to the estimate by taking how many hours previous hours have taken, and then multiplying it by the number of people
So for example if we thought that each person would need to spend eight hours on the project, 8*5 would be 40 hours
Overall since this is our first project, we are ultimately just making an educated guess
Future projects will likely have more accurate estimates

Total Amount of Hours: About 60 hours

Got this total by adding up all of the hours that we recorded. This was significantly higher then what we initially thought it would take, 
which is likely due to the selection and combat phases of the project taking longer than we thought.

PROJECT 2 TEAM 20 
We estimated our person-hours to be around 35 hours as it would take some time learning and comprehending the previous team's code.
The other factor to our estimate was the time it would take to implement the required features for this project. Therefore,
we arrived at 35 hours for our estimate.
The actual breakdown of person-hours is shown below.

James: 10/3 - 8 Hours, 10/4 - 5.5 Hours, 10/5 - 0.5 Hours
        Total: 14 Hours
Konrad: 10/3 - 1 Hour, 10/5 - 3 Hours
        Total: 4 Hours
Cole: 9/30 - 3 Hours, 10/4 - 0.5 Hours, 10/7 - 5 Hours, 10/8 - 1 Hour
        Total: 9.5 Hours
Paul: 10/3 - 1 Hour, 10/4 - 1 Hour, 10/6 - 3 Hours, 10/7 - 2 Hours
        Total 7 Hours

Grand Total: 34.5 Hours
